In order to use this code move the "information.sql" file to "Local Disk (C:)" then run the code,
or go to "LeafyLodge/src/SQLDatabaseConnection" and change the filePath to the current path where information.sql is currently in!

if you run into this Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
you might want to comment vmArgs in launch.json
